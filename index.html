                This is the privacy notice of MA Tech Ltd. In this document,
                “we”, “our”, or “us” refer to Timely Tee Limited. We are company
                number <strong>12627 </strong>registered in England. Our
                registered office is 11 Horton Gate, Giffard Park, Milton

              <p>&nbsp;</p>

              <p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>

              <p>
                1. This is a notice to inform you of our policy about all
                information that we record about you. It sets out the conditions
                under which we may process any information that we collect from
                you, or that you provide to us. It covers information that could
                identify you (“personal information”) and information that could
                not. In the context of the law and this notice, “process” means
                collect, store, transfer, use or otherwise act on information.
              </p>

              <p>
                2. We regret that if there are one or more points below with
                which you are not happy, your only recourse is to leave our
                website immediately or stop using the Timely Tee Application.
              </p>

              <p>
                3. We take seriously the protection of your privacy and
                confidentiality. We understand that all visitors to our website
                and all users of Timely Tee Application are entitled to know
                that their personal data will not be used for any purpose
                unintended by them, and will not accidentally fall into the
                hands of a third party.
              </p>

              <p>
                4. We undertake to preserve the confidentiality of all
                information you provide to us, and hope that you reciprocate.
              </p>

              <p>
                5. Our policy complies with UK law accordingly implemented,
                including that required by the EU General Data Protection
                Regulation (GDPR).
              </p>

              <p>
                6. The law requires us to tell you about your rights and our
                obligations to you regarding the processing and control of your
                personal data. We do this now, by requesting that you read the
                information provided at www.knowyourprivacyrights.org
              </p>

              <p>
                7. Except as set out below, we do not share, or sell, or
                disclose to a third party, any information collected through our
                website or through the Timely Tee Application
              </p>

              <p>&nbsp;</p>

              <p>

                  >The bases on which we process information about you</strong
                >
              </p>

              <p>&nbsp;</p>

              <p>
                The law requires us to determine under which of six defined
                bases we process different categories of your personal
                information, and to notify you of the basis for each category.
              </p>

              <p>
                If a basis on which we process your personal information is no
                longer relevant, then we shall immediately stop processing your
                data. If the basis changes then if required by law, we shall
                notify you of the change and of any new basis under which we
                have determined that we can continue to process your
                information.
              </p>

              <p>&nbsp;</p>

              <p>&nbsp;</p>

              <p>
                <strong
                  >Information we process because we have a contractual
                  obligation with you</strong
                >
              </p>

              <p>&nbsp;</p>

              <p>
                When you create an account on our website or Application, buy a
                product or service from us, or otherwise agree to our Terms and
                Conditions, a contract is formed between you and us. In order to
                carry out our obligations under that contract, we must process
                the information you give us. Some of this information may be
                personal information.
              </p>

              <p>&nbsp;</p>

              <p>We may use it in order to:</p>

              <p>1.1. verify your identity for security purposes</p>

              <p>1.2. advise and sell products/services to you</p>

              <p>1.3. provide you with our services</p>

              <p>
                1.4. provide you with suggestions and advice on products,
                services and how to obtain the most from using our website
              </p>

              <p>&nbsp;</p>

              <p>
                We process this information on the basis there is a contract
                between us, or that you have requested we use the information
                before we enter into a legal contract.
              </p>

              <p>&nbsp;</p>

              <p>
                Additionally, we may aggregate this information in a general way
                and use it to provide class information, for example to monitor
                our performance with respect to a particular service we provide.
                If we use it for this purpose, you as an individual will not be
                personally identifiable.
              </p>

              <p>&nbsp;</p>

              <p>
                We shall continue to process this information until the contract
                between us ends or is terminated by either party under the terms
                of the contract.
              </p>

              <p>&nbsp;</p>

              <p><strong>Information we process with your consent</strong></p>

              <p>&nbsp;</p>

              <p>
                Through certain actions when otherwise there is no contractual
                relationship between us, such as when you browse our website,
                use our Application or ask us to provide you more information
                about our business, including job opportunities and about our
                products and services, you provide your consent to us to process
                information that may be personal information. Wherever possible,
                we aim to obtain your explicit consent to process this
                information, for example, by asking you to agree to our use of
                cookies.
              </p>

              <p>&nbsp;</p>

              <p>
                Sometimes you might give your consent implicitly, such as when
                you send us a message by e-mail to which you would reasonably
                expect us to reply. Except where you have consented to our use
                of your information for a specific purpose, we do not use your
                information in any way that would identify you personally. We
                may aggregate it in a general way and use it to provide class
                information, for example to monitor the performance of a
                particular page on our website.
              </p>

              <p>&nbsp;</p>

              <p>
                If you have given us explicit permission to do so, we may from
                time to time pass your name and contact information to selected
                associates whom we consider may provide services or products you
                would find useful. We continue to process your information on
                this basis until you withdraw your consent, or it can be
                reasonably assumed that your consent no longer exists.
              </p>

              <p>&nbsp;</p>

              <p>
                You may withdraw your consent at any time by instructing us at.
                However, if you do so, you may not be able to use our website,
                Application, or our services further.
              </p>

              <p>&nbsp;</p>

              <p>
                <strong
                  >Information we process for the purposes of legitimate
                  interests</strong
                >
              </p>

              <p>&nbsp;</p>

              <p>
                We may process the information on the basis there is a
                legitimate interest, either to you or to us, of doing so. Where
                we process your information on this basis, we do so after having
                given careful consideration to:
              </p>

              <p>
                • whether the same objective could be achieved through other
                means
              </p>

              <p>
                • whether processing (or not processing) might cause you harm
              </p>

              <p>
                • whether you would expect us to process your data, and whether
                you would, in the round, consider it reasonable to do so
              </p>

              <p>
                For example, we may process your data on this basis for the
                purposes of:
              </p>

              <p>
                • record-keeping for the proper and necessary administration of
                our business
              </p>

              <p>
                • responding to unsolicited communication from you to which we
                believe you would expect a response
              </p>

              <p>• protecting and asserting the legal rights of any party</p>

              <p>
                • insuring against or obtaining professional advice that is
                required to manage business risk
              </p>

              <p>
                • protecting your interests where we believe we have a duty to
                do so
              </p>

              <p>&nbsp;</p>

              <p>
                <strong
                  >Information we process because we have a legal
                  obligation</strong
                >
              </p>

              <p>&nbsp;</p>

              <p>
                We are subject to the law like everyone else. Sometimes, we must
                process your information in order to comply with a statutory
                obligation. For example, we may be required to give information
                to legal authorities if they so request or if they have the
                proper authorisation such as a search warrant or court order.
                This may include your personal information.
              </p>

              <p>
                Our website and Application allows you to post information with
                a view to that information being read, copied, downloaded, or
                used by other people.
              </p>

              <p>Examples include:</p>

              <p>5.1. posting a message on our forum or blog</p>

              <p>5.2. tagging an image</p>

              <p>
                5.3. clicking on an icon next to another visitor’s message to
                convey your agreement, disagreement, or thanks
              </p>

              <p>&nbsp;</p>

              <p>
                In posting personal information, it is up to you to satisfy
                yourself about the privacy level of every person who might use
                it. We do not specifically use this information except to allow
                it to be displayed or shared for business operational purposes.
                We do store it, and we reserve a right to use it in the future
                in any way we decide. Once your information enters the public
                domain, we have no control over what any individual third party
                may do with it. We accept no responsibility for their actions at
                any time.
              </p>

              <p>&nbsp;</p>

              <p>
                Provided your request is reasonable and there is no legal basis
                for us to retain it, then at our discretion we may agree to your
                request to delete personal information that you have posted. You
                can make a request by contacting us at info@timelygolf.com.

                We attempt to moderate user generated content, but we are not
                always able to do so as soon as that content is published. If
                you complain about any of the content on our website or
                Application, we shall investigate your complaint. If we feel it
                is justified or if we believe the law requires us to do so, we
                shall remove the content while we investigate.

              <p>
                Free speech is a fundamental right, so we have to make a
                judgment as to whose right will be obstructed: yours, or that of
                the person who posted the content that offends you. If we think
                your complaint is vexatious or without any basis, we shall not

                Payment information is never taken by us or transferred to us
                either through our website or otherwise. If you subscribe to the
                ‘Premium Service’ through our Application, payment will be made
                using either Apple Pay (on iOS – Apple In-App subscription
                purchase) or Android Pay (Google Pay Billing). All subscription
                plans will be set to monthly recurring. You will be able to view
                any previous billing on the ‘Subscriptions’ page within the
                Application and download the invoice copy. The download will
                send the invoice as a PDF to the user’s email address. If the
                user wishes to cancel their subscription, then they can do this
                on the ‘Subscriptions’ page within the Application. Their
                subscription will then stop at the end of the month they cancel
                their subscription but there will be no refund for the month in
                which they cancel.
              </p>

              <p>&nbsp;</p>

              <p>&nbsp;</p>

              <p>
                User data is saved in the database. The user password is
                encrypted using a hash algorithm. All the data is accessed with
                the help of a unique secure token.

              <p>&nbsp;</p>

              <p>
                Data is secured by JWT Token. For every action performed by a
                user it requires JWT Token sent along with the data.

                If you send us information in connection with a job application,
                we may keep it for up to six years in case we decide to contact
                you at a later date. If we employ you directly or indirectly for
                the purpose of our business, we collect information about you
                and your work from time to time throughout the period of your
                employment or application. This information will be used only
                for purposes directly relevant to your employment. After your
                employment or application to us for our business purposes has
                ended, we will keep your file for six years before destroying or
                deleting it.

                When you contact us, whether by telephone, through our website

              <p>&nbsp;</p>

              <p>
                When we receive a complaint, we record all the information you
                have given to us. We use that information to resolve your
                complaint. If your complaint reasonably requires us to contact
                some other person, we may decide to give to that other person
                some of the information contained in your complaint. We do this
                as infrequently as possible, but it is a matter for our sole
                discretion as to whether we do give information, and if we do,
                what that information is. We may also compile statistics showing
                information obtained from this source to assess the level of
                service we provide, but not in a way that could identify you or
                any other person.
